# CSS Flexbox Photo Gallery

Objective: Use Flexbox to build a responsive photo gallery webpage.

- Flexbox helps design a webpage so that it looks good on any screen size.


Notes:
- To use Flexbox, give an element a display property of flex. 
- This will make the element a flex container. 
- Any direct children of a flex container are called flex items.

- Flexbox has a main and cross axis. The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, which has four possible values:
    1. row (default): horizontal axis with flex items from left to right
    2. row-reverse: horizontal axis with flex items from right to left
    3. column: vertical axis with flex items from top to bottom
    4. column-reverse: vertical axis with flex items from bottom to top

- The flex-wrap property determines how your flex items behave when the flex container is too small. 
    - Setting it to wrap will allow the items to wrap to the next row or column.
    - nowrap (default) will prevent your items from wrapping and shrink them if needed.
